# Coursera: Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization

This project is where I upload my programming assigments for the Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization on Coursera.


The specialization includes 3 courses: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability & Statistics. Below are the contents of each course:


Course 1: Linear Algebra
[Linear Algebra Certification](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17084046/Coursera.FJSDSDQLX3QQ.1.pdf)
* Week 1: System of linear equations: System of equations, Singularity & non-singularity, Linearly dependent & linearly independent, Determinants, Linear systems as matrices
* Week 2: Solving system of linear equation: Matrix row-reduction, Rank of a matrix, Row echelon form, The Gaussian elimination algorithm
