# Coursera: Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization

This repository is where I upload my programming exercises and graded assigments for the Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization on Coursera.


The specialization includes 3 smaller courses: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Probability & Statistics. Below are the contents and my certifications of each course:


Course 1: Linear Algebra
[Linear Algebra Certification](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17084046/Coursera.FJSDSDQLX3QQ.1.pdf)
* Week 1 - System of linear equations: System of equations, Singularity & non-singularity, Linearly dependent & linearly independent, Determinants, Linear systems as matrices
* Week 2 - Solving system of linear equation: Matrix row-reduction, Rank of a matrix, Row echelon form, The Gaussian elimination algorithm
* Week 3 - Vectors and linear transformations: Vector and their properties, Vector operations, Linear transformation
* Week 4 - Determinants and eigenvectors: Singularity and rank of linear transformations, Determinant as a area, Bases and spans in linear algebra, Eigenbases, Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, PCA
